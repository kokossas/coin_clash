What I would like you to do, is based on the project files, I want you to thoroughly examine any relevant file and how it ties to each other and together. Once you have completed this thorough examination, I want you to do the following:
```
Create a guide covering:
- Navigating the project structure, to make sure when giving this project to someone they are able to understand how the structure is and be able to make appropriate modifications based on a new objective, without affecting functionality or structure of existing code
- Understanding match data, how match-related data is structured and managed within the Coin Clash simulation, based strictly on the definitions in core/models.py and usage observed in core/repositories.py and core/engine.py.
- Player profile handling and updates, particularly attributes like balance, wins, kills, and earnings, are represented and updated within the Coin Clash simulation
- Configuration and configuration loading, focusing on the `config.yaml` file and the `core/config_loader.py` script responsible for loading it.
- Database Interaction: Database structure, detailing how player, match, and other game data is stored and managed
- Scenario System: How scenarios are defined, structured, loaded, parsed (from drafts), and integrated into the game engine
- Configuration Deep Dive: Expanding on which specific files or settings control key game parameters and how to modify them safely
- API Layer: Discuss how to create an intermediary layer to separate game logic from a user interface (like the Telegram bot), making integration easier in the future
- SUI Integration Points, make sure you cover the full economic flow end-to-end and double-check that every payment hook is accounted for.
- Error Handling & Logging: Documenting the current error management and logging approach and suggesting potential improvements for a bot environment
**Validate guide completeness against all user points**
