# Coin Clash: Incremental Migration Planning

## Rationale for Incremental Approach

This document outlines a phased approach to transforming Coin Clash into a full-stack Web3 game, beginning with database migration and API layer development before introducing blockchain integration. This incremental strategy offers several key advantages:

1. **Risk Mitigation**: By separating the migration into distinct phases, we reduce the complexity of each development stage and minimize the risk of integration issues.

2. **Early Validation**: The database and API layer can be tested and validated independently, ensuring a solid foundation before adding blockchain complexity.

3. **Continuous Delivery**: This approach enables the delivery of functional increments that provide immediate value while progressing toward the full Web3 vision.

4. **Technical Debt Prevention**: Proper abstraction layers established early will prevent technical debt that could arise from retrofitting blockchain functionality into a monolithic system.

5. **Team Specialization**: Allows backend and frontend teams to make progress while blockchain specialists focus on integration points.

## Phase 1: Database and API Layer

### Architecture Overview

The initial phase will focus on establishing a robust database and API foundation that is designed with future blockchain integration in mind.

### Database Migration Strategy

#### 1. PostgreSQL Migration

The current SQLite database will be migrated to PostgreSQL for several reasons:

- **Scalability**: PostgreSQL offers superior performance for concurrent access and larger datasets.
- **Transaction Support**: Robust transaction support is critical for financial operations in later phases.
- **JSON Support**: Native JSON/JSONB support will facilitate blockchain data storage.
- **Extensibility**: PostgreSQL's extension ecosystem supports future needs like geographic queries or full-text search.

#### 2. Schema Extensions

The database schema will be extended to include:

- **Wallet-Ready Player Model**: The Player model will be extended to support future wallet associations without requiring schema changes.
- **Transaction-Ready Match Model**: The Match model will include fields for future transaction references.
- **Blockchain-Ready Event Logging**: The event system will be prepared for blockchain event integration.

#### 3. Abstraction Layers

Key abstraction layers will be implemented to isolate blockchain-specific code in future phases:

- **Payment Provider Interface**: An abstract interface for payment processing that can be implemented by both traditional and blockchain providers.
- **Identity Provider Interface**: An abstraction for authentication that will support both traditional and wallet-based authentication.
- **Asset Management Interface**: An abstraction for managing in-game assets that will later support tokenization.

### API Layer Design

#### 1. REST API Architecture

The API will follow REST principles with:

- **Resource-Based Endpoints**: Clear resource mapping for players, matches, characters, etc.
- **Consistent Response Formats**: Standardized error and success responses.
- **Pagination Support**: For listing endpoints to support scaling.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Advanced query capabilities for resource collections.

#### 2. Authentication Framework

The authentication system will be designed to support multiple authentication methods:

- **Phase 1**: Traditional username/password and API key authentication.
- **Future**: Seamless extension to support wallet signature-based authentication.

#### 3. API Versioning

The API will include versioning from the start to facilitate future changes:

- **URL-Based Versioning**: `/api/v1/resource`
- **Deprecation Strategy**: Clear documentation and headers for API lifecycle management.

#### 4. Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation will be generated using:

- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Automatic documentation generation from code.
- **Usage Examples**: Clear examples for all endpoints.
- **SDK Generation**: Preparation for generating client SDKs.

## Phase 1 Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI
  - **Rationale**: High-performance Python web framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation, perfect for creating RESTful APIs.

- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (existing in codebase)
  - **Rationale**: Maintain compatibility with existing codebase while providing powerful ORM capabilities.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
  - **Rationale**: Robust, open-source relational database with excellent support for complex queries and transactions.

- **Migration Tool**: Alembic
  - **Rationale**: Seamless integration with SQLAlchemy for database migrations.

- **Authentication**: JWT with multiple provider support
  - **Rationale**: Industry standard for stateless authentication that can be extended to support wallet signatures.

### Frontend (Initial)
- **Framework**: React with Next.js
  - **Rationale**: Next.js provides server-side rendering capabilities, optimized performance, and excellent developer experience.

- **UI Components**: Chakra UI
  - **Rationale**: Accessible component library with theming support and responsive design out of the box.

- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
  - **Rationale**: Robust state management with simplified boilerplate and built-in immutability.

### Development Environment
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
  - **Rationale**: Consistent development environment and simplified deployment.

- **Testing**: pytest for backend, Jest for frontend
  - **Rationale**: Industry standard testing frameworks with excellent ecosystem support.

## Blockchain Integration Preparation

While Phase 1 focuses on database and API development, several preparations will be made for future blockchain integration:

### 1. Data Models with Blockchain Fields

Key models will include fields that will be used in future blockchain integration:

- **Player Model**: Fields for wallet addresses (initially null).
- **Transaction Model**: Skeleton for recording financial transactions with blockchain-specific fields.
- **Match Model**: Fields for recording blockchain settlement status.

### 2. Service Interfaces for Payment Processing

Abstract interfaces will be defined for payment processing:

```python
class PaymentProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def process_deposit(self, player_id: int, amount: float, currency: str) -> Dict:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def process_withdrawal(self, player_id: int, amount: float, currency: str) -> Dict:
        pass
```

Initial implementation will use a mock provider, with blockchain providers added in future phases.

### 3. Authentication Service Design

The authentication service will be designed to support multiple authentication methods:

```python
class AuthProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def authenticate(self, credentials: Dict) -> Dict:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def generate_token(self, user_id: int) -> str:
        pass
```

### 4. API Endpoints for Future Blockchain Features

Placeholder API endpoints will be defined for future blockchain features:

- `/api/v1/wallets` (reserved for future wallet management)
- `/api/v1/transactions` (reserved for future transaction management)
- `/api/v1/chains` (reserved for future chain management)

These endpoints will return appropriate "not implemented" responses in Phase 1.

## Match Lifecycle Adaptation

The match lifecycle will be adapted to support the new architecture while maintaining the core game mechanics:

### 1. Match Creation and Configuration

- API endpoints for match creation and configuration
- Database storage of match parameters
- Preparation for future blockchain-based entry fees

### 2. Player Join Phase

- API endpoints for joining matches
- Player validation and character selection
- Preparation for future blockchain-based entry validation

### 3. Match Execution

- Asynchronous match execution
- Event emission for frontend updates
- Database recording of match events

### 4. Results and Rewards

- API endpoints for retrieving match results
- Calculation of rewards and statistics
- Preparation for future blockchain-based reward distribution
