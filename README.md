# Coin Clash

Coin Clash is a backend game engine being transformed into a full-stack Web3 game through an incremental migration approach.

## Project Overview

Coin Clash is a multiplayer game where players purchase characters to enter matches, compete for survival, and earn rewards. The game features:

- Character purchase and management
- Match creation and participation
- Real-time match simulation with various event types
- Player statistics and rewards

This repository contains the backend game engine and the ongoing migration to a modern API-based architecture with future blockchain integration capabilities.

## Migration Status

The project is currently in Phase 2 of an incremental migration plan:

- âœ… Phase 1: Database migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL
  - âœ… REST API implementation with FastAPI
  - âœ… Authentication system with JWT
  - âœ… Service layer abstraction
  - âœ… Blockchain integration preparation

- âœ… Phase 2: Blockchain Abstraction Layer (Current)
  - âœ… Wallet interface and mock provider
  - âœ… Payment interface and mock provider
  - âœ… Transaction interface and mock provider
  - âœ… Asset interface and mock provider
  - âœ… Blockchain error handling and retry mechanisms
  - âœ… Service factory for provider management

- ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Blockchain Integration (Next)
  - ðŸ”„ Polygon and Solana provider implementations
  - ðŸ”„ Smart contract integration
  - ðŸ”„ Frontend wallet connection

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- pytest-asyncio (for running blockchain abstraction tests)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kokossas/coin_clash.git
   cd coin_clash
   git checkout phase2_blockchain_abs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   pip install pytest-asyncio  # Required for blockchain tests
   ```

3. Set up PostgreSQL:
   ```
   # Create a PostgreSQL database
   createdb coin_clash
   
   # Or use Docker
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   ```

4. Run database migrations:
   ```
   # Once Alembic is set up
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. Start the API server:
   ```
   uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Running Tests

```
# Run all tests
pytest backend/tests/

# Run blockchain abstraction tests specifically
pytest backend/tests/services/blockchain/
```

## Blockchain Abstraction Layer

The blockchain abstraction layer provides a clean separation between game logic and blockchain implementations, allowing for:

- Development and testing without actual blockchain dependencies
- Support for multiple blockchain networks (Polygon, Solana)
- Consistent error handling and retry mechanisms
- Future extensibility for additional chains

### Key Components

- **Wallet Interface**: Connect to wallets, verify signatures, manage chain support
- **Payment Interface**: Process deposits/withdrawals, check balances, estimate fees
- **Transaction Interface**: Create and monitor blockchain transactions
- **Asset Interface**: Create, transfer, and update blockchain assets (NFTs)

### Mock Providers

All interfaces include mock implementations that simulate blockchain behavior with:
- Configurable network delays
- Simulated transaction lifecycles
- Realistic error scenarios
- In-memory state management

For detailed documentation, see [PHASE2_CHANGES.md](PHASE2_CHANGES.md).

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, API documentation is available at:

- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc
